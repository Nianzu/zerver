                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>Over the past few years, I've been learning Chinese. As many language learners will tell you,
                        learning a language is all about input. The more you can immerse yourself in the language, the
                        quicker you can learn. And with Chinese specifically, it can be really hard to read words you
                        don't
                        understand. In German, if you don't know that "liebe" means "love", you at least know how to
                        type it
                        and pronounce it. In Chinese, if you don't know that "爱" means "love" you won't have any way to
                        type
                        or say the word. How will you look it up in a dictionary?</p>
                    <p>Mandarin Navigator aims to solve that problem for e-books. It completely transforms a standard
                        e-book
                        file into a webpage, that allows you to hover over words and see possible translations for those
                        words, as well as how too say/type the word.</p>

                    <h2>Translation Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The current translation methodology is designed for speed and ease of implementation, at the cost
                        of
                        context sensitivity and accuracy. The system uses a dictionary of 121,366 common Chinese words
                        in
                        both traditional and simplified character sets, provided by <a
                            href="https://cc-cedict.org/wiki/">CC-CEDICT</a>.</p>
                    <p>The algorithm works by breaking down each paragraph of the ebook into individual words. It starts
                        by
                        matching the longest word it can find to an entry in the dictionary. Then, it repeats this
                        process
                        for the remaining words on either side until the entire sentence has been translated or no
                        further
                        breakdown is possible.</p>
                    <p>This methodology offers several benefits, such as the ability to easily update the dictionary and
                        ignore any non-Mandarin words or characters, such as punctuation. Additionally, by swapping the
                        dictionary file, this methodology could theoretically be used to translate text in other
                        logographic
                        languages.</p>
                    <p>The primary assumption of this methodology is that longer words are more likely to be the
                        intended
                        meaning than shorter words.</p>
                    <p>Note: While this methodology is relatively simple, it may not always provide the most accurate or
                        context-sensitive translations. However, it is a good starting point for further development and
                        improvement.</p>
