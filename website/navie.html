      <p>A little robot that navigates entirely on its own. Hence the name, Navie.</p>

      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p>Navie is a project that was designed to help improve my skills with C programming on raspberry pi, as well as gain a better understanding of SLAM and robot navigation in general. The project is currently considered blocked. I ran into a problem implementing the dead-reckoning where the encoder on the motors I purchased were not working to spec. I plan to pick this project back up once the BLDC project has been completed.</p>
