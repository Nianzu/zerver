## Contributions

I normally say that contributions are welcome, but you really shouldn't use this or contribute to it. I make no claims. This might burn down your PC, summon the FBI to your door, and start a botnet that neither you nor I can control. Buyer beware.

## License

This project is not currently licensed; it will not be lisenced. Do with it what you want.
